    <h1>Welcome to Rubikdom</h1>
    <h4>The realm of the Great Beast</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p> Far far away, somwhere between the realms of Bologna and Reggio, there was Rubikdom, the realm of the Great Beast (aka: Cioppi).
      <br><br> It wasn't a very big place but it was full of wonders and long lost crunchy treats.
      <br><br> The undisputed ruler and protector of the realm, <strong>Rubik</strong>, ruled over it with an ironpaw.
      <br><br> Whoever dared disobeying him was bitten, scratched or even waken up by jumping on his balls.
      <br><br> It was a reign of terror and unceirtainty.

    <h3>Things the great Beast likes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> the "Pappa"</li>
      <li> sleeping 16 hours a day</li>
      <li> conveying attention on himself when others have very important things to do</li>
      <li> terroryzing the neighborhood with fearsome noises</li>
      <li> running around his realm like he's under drugs</li>
      <li> sleeping on his servants's balls making sleep for them very uncomfortable</li>
